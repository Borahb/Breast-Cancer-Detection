This a  ML model to detect the cancer cells whether Benign or Malignant.
This a ML model created using  Random Forest Model and also tried with KNN model with dataset of 568 entries.And the results I got is amazing ,the KNN model fits the data well and the prediction is almost true.You can find results through the confusion matrix.
