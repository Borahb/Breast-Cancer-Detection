This a  ML model to detect the cancer cells whether Benign or Malignant.
This a ML model created using  Random Forest  Regressor Model and  with KNN model ,with Naive bayes,with Decision Tree Classification and and Random forest Classification model with dataset of 568 entries.And the results I got is amazing ,the KNN model fits the data well and the prediction is astonishing.The Results through the confusion matrix for KNN found was only 3 incorret predictions out of 57 entries.
The KNN model gives a f1 score of 0.933 and accuracy score of 0.947.And for the Random Forest Classication model confusion matrix is found only 2 incorrect prediction. The f1 score for Random Forest Classification Model is 0.956 and accuracy score is 0.964.
